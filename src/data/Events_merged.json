We are excited to be participating in this year‚Äôs Northside 4th of July Parade, and are looking for volunteers to join our parade ensemble. üòé\r\n\r\nVolunteers will represent Give Back Cincinnati throughout the duration of the parade and pass out GBC swag to spectators along the route. A GBC tank top will be available for volunteers while supplies last. More info about parade day below! \r\n\r\nPARKING FOR NON-PARADE VEHICLES:\r\n\r\nParking is unavailable for vehicles that aren‚Äôt IN the parade at the Greater Bethlehem Temple Church; all non-parade vehicles will need to park at the McKie Recreation Center (1655 Chase Ave) and shuttle over to the Greater Bethlehem Temple Church (4781 Hamilton Ave). The shuttle runs 9:30AM until 11:30AM. \r\nSTAGING LOT SET UP:\r\n\r\nWhen you arrive at the Greater Bethlehem Temple Church‚Äôs parking lot, you will want to find Give Back Cincinnati in section RED. Our exact parade number is 78. If you have difficulties in locating us, please find a Northside 4th of July Parade volunteer and inform them that you are looking for RED 78.\r\nOTHER DETAILS:\r\n\r\nWe will supply all volunteers with GBC tank tops to wear during the parade; however, please feel free to get festive with your accessories.\r\nGBC volunteers will either be handing out bottle open keychains to the crowd (do not throw, be sure to hand items to the crowd), waving flags, carrying our banner, squirting water guns, blowing bubbles, or whatever other crazy things we bring along with us. This event is all about having some fun so be ready to have a blast! J\r\nWater, sunscreen and bug-spray will be available to all volunteers in our float.\r\nThere is a port-o-let behind the shuttle pick-up, and two near the staging lot, but that‚Äôs it. Be prepared.\r\nPARADE END:\r\n\r\nCelebrate a successful parade at the Northside Rock ‚Äòn Roll Carnival at Hoffner Park. All GBC volunteers who participated in the parade will receive a beer on us!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom the Northside 4th of July Parade Facebook event:\r\n\r\nParade steps off at noon on Thursday, July 4th 2019. The parade starts at the northern boundary of Northside at Hamilton Avenue and Ashtree Drive and travels south on Hamilton Avenue to Hoffner Park. Roads will close approximately 10 minutes before parade start.\r\n\r\nThe mission of the Northside Fourth of July Parade is to celebrate independence and to serve as a tool for community building. Parade organizers work to invite and involve people from all corners of the community as both participants and viewers. The parade offers a way to get to know one‚Äôs neighbors through a shared light-hearted activity. Neighbors who know one another and have laughed together are more inclined to be involved and to make their neighborhood a nicer place to live.
